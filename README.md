# prex

Approximate Regular Expression Matching for Java. prex determines
how far a string *s* is from matching a regular expression *r*,
*i.e.* how many insertions, deletions and substitutions on *s* are at least required (minimum cost) such that the resulting
string *s'* is acceptable by *r*.

# Approach

The prex algorithm is inspired by the [work of Myers and
Millers](http://www.cs.mun.ca/~harold/Courses/Old/Ling6800.W06/Diary/reg.aprox.pdf)
who provide an algorithm for solving the approximate regular
expression matching problem. However, their approach requires a special pre-computed
data-structure called edit-graph *e* that encodes all possible matches and mismatches
of *s* with respect to
*r* which requires approximately 15xSxR edges and SxR vertices
where S denotes the length of *s* and R is the length of *r*.
Given that data structure, their approach searches a minimal cost path
in *e* with a worst-case time complexity of
O(SxR). The main strengths
of Myers and Millers approach are the possibility to use real-valued costs for insertion,
deletion and substitution, respectively, and its worst-case time complexity. The drawback, however,
is that the edit-graph has to be created upfront.

Similar to Myers and Millers approach, one can also define real-valued cost
for deletion, insertion and substitution in prex. However, prex is based on the branch and bounds method
(+ extended list) and does not rely on a precomputed edit-graph. Because,
prex is using branch and bounds, in theory it has the same worst-case time complexity as exhaustive
search. However, our goal is to keep
the algorithm as simple as possible and to achieve a reasonable performance in practice by incorporating heuristics.

# Usage

prex can be used as a standalone command line tool and as a library.

## Standalone

One could compile prex by running `mvn package` on the command line. The resulting `jar` archive
can be called with `java -jar prex.jar` and provides the following command line options:

| Option               | Description                                         |
|----------------------|:----------------------------------------------------|
| -c,--cost &lt;cost&gt;   |cost values &lt;insertion&gt; &lt;substitution&gt; &lt;deletion&gt;|                      
| -h                   |  print this message                                 |
| -ic,--ignore-case    |  ignore case of s when matching against r           |
| -n,--normalize       |      normalize cost to a value in range [0,1]       |
| -r,--regex &lt;regex&gt; |  regular expression                                 |
| -s,--string &lt;string&gt; |  constant string                                  |
| -t,--print-tree      |  print branch and bounds edit tree                  |


## Library

The following code snippet shows how to use prex after the `jar` file
is imported into your project:

```java
// invoke Prex constructor with regular expression definition,
// r = gcg[abc]+
// default costs for substitution, insertion and deletion are 1.0,
// but they are modifiable
Prex am = new Prex("gcg[abc]+");
// get cost to make s = GCGa matching r = gcg[abc]+
// ignore case and return a value in range [0,1]
System.out.println(am.evaluateCost("GCGa", true, true));
// get cost to make s = GCGa matching r = gcg[abc]+
// do not ignore case and return a value in range [0,1]
System.out.println("GCGa", false, true));
// ignore case and do not normalize
System.out.println(am.evaluateCost("GCGa", true, false));
// do not ignore case and do not normalize
System.out.println(am.evaluateCost("GCGa", false, false));
```

The results of the invocations above look as follows:

```bash
0.0
0.75
0.0
3.0
```
